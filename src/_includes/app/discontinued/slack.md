> Hello,
> 
> My name is XXX and I work for Slack. One of the things I do here is help companies and developers understand how to stay between the lines with respect to our App Developer Policy and Brand Guidelines. I'm contacting you today regarding the Slack Portable app (found here: https://portapps.io/app/slack-portable/).
> 
> Wrappers like Portapps' applications are cause for concern from a security standpoint. It's possible to modify or embed code or leave a record of user tokens on machines where the application is used.
> 
> Per our App Developer Policy, we state that you may not…
> 
> "…attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, hack, disable, interfere with, disassemble, modify, copy, translate, or disrupt the features, functionality, integrity, or performance of the Services (including any mechanism used to restrict or control the functionality of the Services), any third party use of the Services, or any third party data contained therein (except to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law)…"
> 
> Because Slack Portable provides a way to circumvent the intended functionality of our product, we must ask that you remove it from your website.
> 
> The Slack Portable application violates a number of Slack's brand guidelines as well. Our concerns in this regard will likely be resolved when distribution of Slack Portable ceases and all references to the Slack name and logo are removed from your website.
> 
> Please reply to this message to let me know that you've received it and provide a reasonable timeline for the removal of Slack Portable. We are not interested in squelching creativity or stopping people from encouraging the use of our platform. However, our name and our brand are very important symbols of trust for our customers and we need to make sure that trust is not violated, even inadvertently, by non-Slack products.

> Hi XXX,
> 
> First of all, thank you for your message.
> 
> Many developers don't like having their computers polluted and like to walk around with their favorite application. That's why I allowed myself a few years ago to make your application portable.
> 
> I would like to point out that Slack Portable, like all the applications on Portapps, do not undergo any modification, decompilation or hacking.
> Indeed, only one wrapper is developed and is completely dissociated from your product. It only runs slack.exe by adding environment variables, switches that make your application portable as most users could.
> 
> As far as your Trademark Policy is concerned, it is true that I am completely at fault and I would like to apologize for that. I hope you understand that I am not trying to harm your product in any way. That is why I specify at the top of the page https://portapps.io/app/slack-portable/ a notice of non-affiliation and exemption from liability.
> 
> If it concerns the logo and name, is it possible that I could change it? Or do you absolutely want to see this page disappear?
> 
> Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
> 
> We look forward to hearing from you,
> 
> Regards,<br />

> Hi Max,
> 
> Thank you for your prompt reply. I have shared your reply with my team here and we plan to follow up with you on Monday. We appreciate your assurances and willingness to engage with us. We'll be in touch soon.

> Hi Max,
> 
> As promised, I'm circling back per our correspondence last week. I spoke with my team here and it is our preference that you please remove the Slack Portable app from your page. Creating light-weight applications makes sense for apps that take up a lot of space, but Slack can run in a web browser which should mitigate the need for this type of alternative.<br />
> Some developers may wish to modify or disrupt the functionality of Slack through their own products.  While we understand and appreciate that you're operating in good faith, we have to be consistent in the application of our policies.<br />
> Please let me know how much time you'll reasonably need in order to remove the Slack wrapper from portapps.io and GitHub. If you are still interested in developing for Slack (which I hope you are), I encourage you to check out api.slack.com. There are lots of resources for developers and our developer relations team is always eager to help navigate our product and policies.

> Hi XXX,
> 
> Very well. I will close the GitHub repository but for transparency purposes with users using this portable application, I will leave an explanatory note on the end of the distribution of Slack portable.
> 
> These changes can be made within 2 to 3 days if it is convenient for you.

> That all sounds good to me. Again, I appreciate your responsiveness and assistance. Please let me know if I (or anyone else at Slack) can ever be of assistance.
