### Add folder sync connection

When you choose what you want to synchronize from {{ include.app.label }} Desktop Client, be sure to enter the following path `..\data\storage\example` to make the content portable (replace `example` with a value of your choice) :

![](/img/app/nextcloud/localfolder.png)

![](/img/app/nextcloud/localfolder2.png)

Data will be stored here :

![](/img/app/nextcloud/localfolder3.png)
